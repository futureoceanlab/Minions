### Light Optical Analysis
Different combinations of the LED and the reflector/lens output different
radial intensity profiles. We took images of their light beams to 
identify the full width half maximum (FWHM). **analyuzeLightOptics.m** 
takes the images from 'data' and provides a graph of radial intensity 
profile of various combinations.
