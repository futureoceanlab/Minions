### Detectability
Depending on the noise, ESD and depth of the particles, the particle may
not be detectable. This affects the effective imaging volume per ESD, and 
it is important to know this for computing the concentration. 
**analyzeDetectability.m** simulates how these variables affect the effective
volume.
