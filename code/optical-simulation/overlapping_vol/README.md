### Overlapping Imaging Volume
We would like to know how much of the imaging volumes of the cameras overlap.
Particles that are visible within that volume can be tracked in 3D space. In
this directory, we study how the overlapping volume is affected by the pan 
angle given the baseline. The script is available in **overlapVolPanAngle.m**.
