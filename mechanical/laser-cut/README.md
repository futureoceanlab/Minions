## Laser Cutting Parts
Throughout the project, we had to rig up some mechanical parts to test and calibrate cameras. 

-*camera-chassis*: These are used as chassis for the cameras that were installed inside 2'' 
bluerobotics acrylic housing. 

-*resolution-test*: A camera and lens were tested on a single resolution test setup using 
an 80/20 aluminum bars and rail. These parts were welded using an acrylic welder.

-*ptv*: We have designed another 80/20 aluminum bar based mechanical structure to calibrate
stereo pairs. Laser cutting was necessary to mount a rotating platform for rotating the cameras
and to mount the potted particle for manual simulation.
